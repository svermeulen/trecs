# Fixed Collections

Components must be unmanaged structs, so a component field can't hold a `List<T>` or an array. For small bounded collections inside a component — equipment slots, active buffs, tracked targets — `Trecs.Collections` provides two size-specialized value types that store elements inline.

| Type | Shape | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| [`FixedArray<N>`](#fixedarrayn) | Fixed length, every slot always live | The count is the capacity — no runtime "how many?" |
| [`FixedList<N>`](#fixedlistn) | Fixed capacity, variable `Count` | The count varies per entity up to a known bound |

Both require `T : unmanaged`. Available sizes: `2`, `4`, `8`, `16`, `32`, `64`, `128`, `256`.

All fixed collections are marked `[NonCopyable]` because their data is stored inline — copying the struct duplicates the internal storage, and mutations on the copy silently leave the original unchanged. Pass them by `ref` or `in`, not by value. Any struct that contains a fixed-collection field is itself non-copyable (the rule propagates transitively). See [Copy semantics](../core/components.md#copy-semantics) for details.

## Read / write split

The indexer returns `ref readonly T` — read with `arr[i]`, but you can't write through it. Writes go through `.Mut(i)`, which returns `ref T`:

```csharp
ref readonly var x = ref arr[i];  // readonly ref (no copy, works through `in` too)
arr.Mut(i) = 5;                    // write (requires mutable reference to arr)
ref var r = ref arr.Mut(i);        // mutable ref for in-place updates
r += 1;
```

This makes `in FixedArray<N>` / `in FixedList<N>` parameters safe: readers can index freely (no defensive copy, no hidden mutation), and writes fail to compile because `Mut` is a `this ref` extension that can't be called through a readonly reference.

```csharp
void Foo(in FixedArray16<int> arr)
{
    int x = arr[0];      // OK
    arr.Mut(0) = 5;      // COMPILE ERROR: arr is readonly, can't call `Mut`
}
```

## `FixedArray<N>`

A fixed-length array stored inline. `default(FixedArray8<float3>)` gives 8 zeroed slots; nothing to initialize.

```csharp
using Trecs.Collections;

public partial struct Waypoints : IEntityComponent
{
    public FixedArray8<float3> Points;
}

ref Waypoints wp = ref handle.Component<Waypoints>(world).Write;
wp.Points.Mut(0) = new float3(1, 0, 0);
ref readonly float3 p = ref wp.Points[2];   // ref readonly — no element copy
ref float3 m = ref wp.Points.Mut(3);         // mutable ref
m.x += 1.0f;
```

**Members:** `Length`, readonly indexer, `==` / `!=`.
**Extension:** `Mut(i)` → `ref T`.

## `FixedList<N>`

A `FixedList<N><T>` is a `FixedArray<N><T>` plus a `Count` of live slots. `Capacity` is fixed at `N`; `Count` starts at `0` and grows with `Add` up to `Capacity`.

```csharp
public partial struct ContactPoints : IEntityComponent
{
    public FixedList16<EntityHandle> Contacts;
}

ref ContactPoints cp = ref handle.Component<ContactPoints>(world).Write;
cp.Contacts.Add(otherHandle);

// Remove-during-iterate: walk backwards to avoid index skips.
for (int i = cp.Contacts.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--)
{
    if (ShouldRemove(cp.Contacts[i]))
        cp.Contacts.RemoveAtSwapBack(i);
}
```

**Members:** `Count`, `Capacity`, `IsEmpty`, readonly indexer, `==` / `!=`.
**Extensions:** `Mut(i)`, `Add`, `Clear`, `RemoveAt`, `RemoveAtSwapBack`.

| Operation | Cost | Preserves order? |
|---|---|---|
| `Add(item)` | O(1) | — |
| `Clear()` | O(1) (just resets `Count`; does not zero the buffer) | — |
| `RemoveAt(i)` | O(N) (shifts trailing elements) | Yes |
| `RemoveAtSwapBack(i)` | O(1) (overwrites slot `i` with the last element) | No |
| `Mut(i) = x` | O(1) | — |

`==` compares `Count` and live slots only — bytes past `Count` (leftover from prior `Clear` / `RemoveAt` calls, or uninitialized) are ignored.

## Choosing a size

The type name picks the footprint. A `FixedArray256<float4x4>` is **16 KB** per entity, used or not. Pick the smallest variant that covers your worst case, rounding up to the next power of two — for a `FixedList<100>`, use `FixedList128` and accept the slack. Memory is usually cheap.

## When to reach for something else

- **The upper bound varies widely across entities, or usually sits far below the cap.** A `FixedArray256<T>` that's typically empty wastes storage on every entity in the template. Use a [dynamic collection](../experimental/dynamic-collections.md) (`TrecsList<T>` / `TrecsArray<T>` / `TrecsDictionary<TKey, TValue>`) instead — the component holds a small inline handle and the elements grow on the world's heap, snapshot-safe.

## Relation to Unity's `FixedList*Bytes`

Unity's `Unity.Collections` ships `FixedList32Bytes<T>` through `FixedList4096Bytes<T>` — same idea, different axis. Differences:

| | Trecs | Unity `FixedList*Bytes` |
|---|---|---|
| Sizing axis | Element count (`FixedList16<T>` = 16 slots, always) | Total bytes (`FixedList64Bytes<T>` = `~62 / sizeof(T)` slots) |
| Element read | `ref readonly T` — zero-copy, including through `in` parameters | `T` by value — copies the element on every read. `.ElementAt(i)` returns `ref T` but isn't callable through `in` |
| Element write | `.Mut(i)` returns `ref T`; not callable through `in` (compile-error) | `list[i] = x` setter; not callable through `in` (compile-error) |
| API surface | Minimal: `Add`, `Clear`, `RemoveAt`, `RemoveAtSwapBack`, `Mut` | Extensive: `IndexOf`, `Contains`, `Sort`, `IEnumerable<T>`, cross-size equality |
| Count-less variant | `FixedArray<N>` | none |
